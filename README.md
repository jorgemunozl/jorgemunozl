# Hi there, I’m Jorge Munoz 👋

## 🔭 About Me

I’m deeply passionate about STEM and computer science. I love combining **mathematics** with **programming** to solve complex problems and build creative solutions.

* 🌱 I’m currently exploring vision models, reinforcement learning, and other machine learning techniques.
* 👯 I’m open to collaborating on anything jeje.
* 🤔 I enjoy deep thinking and theoretical challenges as much as hands‑on coding.

## 💻 Languages & Libraries

* **Languages:** Python, C++, MATLAB
* **Libraries & Frameworks:**

  * **Machine Learning & AI:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit‑learn
  * **Generative & Diffusion:** Hugging Face Diffusers
  * **Reinforcement Learning:** Stable Baselines3, custom RL environments
  * **Tooling & Integration:** LangChain, LangGraph
* **Other Tools:** Git & GitHub, Jupyter Notebooks, VS Code

## 🔬 Research & Projects

* **Reinforcement Learning** — building agents to solve decision‑making tasks.
* **Physics Programming** — simulations and numeric methods in Python & C++.
